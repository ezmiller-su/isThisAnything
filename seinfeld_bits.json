It doesn’t exist.\nWe walk into these places with the big signs out front, “Dry\nCleaning,” and for some reason\nnever question how they were able to put this absurd concept over on us.\nIf I gave you a filthy shirt and said, “I want this immaculate. No liquids!”\nWhat are you going to do? Shake it? Tap it? Blow on it?\nYou almost can’t get something dirty with dry, let alone clean it.\nAnd “One-Hour Martinizing.”\nYou know what I think One-Hour Martinizing is?\nI think they just put the clothes in plastic and give it right back to you.\nThat’s One-Hour Martinizing.\nYou can get One-Second Martinizing if you want it.\nI wonder if the dry cleaners ever wear the clothes?\nWhy not?\nImagine bumping into your dry cleaner at a party and he’s wearing your sweater?\n(loud whisper) “Hey!!\nWhat the hell are you doing?!\nThat better be ready by tomorrow.”"

It’s a tight window, so zip it in there.”\nAnd he does.\nHe’s got a great smile, good energy.\nHe’s got a nice little weight problem going for himself, which is good.\nMakes him real.\nYou believe him.\nHe looks like a guy that’s had a lot of leaks in his life. A lot of coming home opening his front door and half of everything he owns just floats by.\nBowling shoes, hot dog buns, MyPillow.\nI don’t know why but I am 100% sure that Phil Swift has MyPillow.\nAnd no, I do not think it is relevant that it’s $19.99 for a can of Flex Seal, to fix a hole in a bucket.\nAnd I know I can get a new bucket for $3.99.\nIt’s not about the bucket.\nThe point of Flex Seal is just using Flex Seal.\nAnd that’s the only problem with Flex Seal.\nBecause if you do not have a leak, you cannot use it.\nWhich is the situation I am in,\nand where our story takes a heartbreaking turn.\nAnd they don’t talk about this in the commercial. Nobody cares about someone like me,\nbecause they don’t know the frustration that you feel\nwhen you have the solution, but you do not have the problem.\nI’ve never had one of my kids come up to me and say, “Dad, you fixed the leak.\nYou saved the house.\nYou’re the best.”\nI’ve never heard that.\nAnd that’s not a hole in a pipe.\nThat’s a hole in your life, and even Flex Seal can’t patch that up.\nAnd so, I sit there at night\nAlone in the dark, the blue TV light just flickering on my face.\nWatching the leaks get fixed.\nDreaming my Flex Seal fantasies. That I somehow, perhaps by mistake, bought a boat that has a screen door built into the bottom.\nOr I bought two halves of a boat that are not joined together.\nFrom a divorce settlement or something.\nWho’s making boats like this?\nHow did the salesman get me to overlook these gigantic boat issues?\nI don’t know the answer to any of these questions, but I know what I’m going to do about it.\nAnd the next scene is me and Phil Swift just zipping through the Everglades.\n(Holding outboard tiller.)\nMe in my screen-door-bottom boat.\nPhil is in his two halves of a boat glued back together.\nAnd we are laughing our fat asses off.\n“Hey, Phil!”\n“Hey, Jerry!”\nThat’s my dream. And it’s not a wet dream, thanks to Flex Seal."
